Reference 3: http://idratherbewriting.com/events-and-listeners-javascript/
many times you'll want to start functions when a user clicks a link, enters a form, scrolls, moves his or her mouse over an object, or does something else. These actions are called events. You can set specific functions to run when the user performs an event. These functions "listen" for an event and then initiate the function.
