2) what is grid system in bootstrap?
Reference1: http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_grid_system.asp
Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange depending on the screen size:
On a big screen it might look better with the content organized in three columns, but on a small 
screen it would be better if the content items were stacked on top of each other.
Reference2: https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-the-bootstrap-3-grid-system
The new Bootstrap grid system applies to mobile first. When you declare a specific grid size, that 
is the grid for that size and above. This can be a little hard to grasp at first so here’s an example.
For example, let’s say you want a site that has:
1 column on extra small devices
2 columns on small AND medium devices
4 columns on large devices

Like any grid system, the Bootstrap grid is a library of HTML/CSS components that allow you to

That’s where Bootstraps grid system comes into play. It gives you simple to use tools (css-classes in
fact), to make your life easyer! The Bootstrap gridsystem is probably the best of all available, as
they took care about every possible situation you can face. Further it’s developed with mobile first in
mind.

Bootstrap includes a powerful mobile-first grid system for building layouts of all shapes and sizes.

it with Sass mixins or our predefined classes.

layout which we would like see for the particular design.

3) for 1 row how many columns do we have in bootstrap?
Reference1: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19732763/bootstrap-3-nested-row-can-i-have-columns-add-up-to-more-then-12
Yes, it's ok to have more that 12 columns in a row It will just make the extra columns wrap to the next line.
Reference2: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html
For a simple two column layout, create a .row and add the appropriate number of .span* columns. As this is a 12-column grid,
each .span* spans a number of those 12 columns, and should always add up to 12 for each row (or the number of columns in the 
parent).
Reference3: http://getbootstrap.com/css/

viewport size increases.
