1) what are semantic element? 
Reference1:http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Reference2:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML
Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web 
applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look.

Reference3: http://computer.howstuffworks.com/html-five5.htm
Semantic elements in HTML5 are, as their name implies, those that refer to the meaning of certain content. Just using 
<body> tags alone isn't enough, since most Web sites today contain several different types of content on a single page. Web 
developers need to apply separate rules for how each type of content should look or behave.

Reference4: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31856/semantic-element
A semantic element is an element of code that uses words to clearly represent what that element contains, in human language. 
For practical purposes, many of those researching semantic elements are looking at English language words used for the purposes
of semantic labeling.

Reference5: http://webdesign.about.com/od/htmltags/a/why-semantic-html.htm
Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example,
 a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational, because people know what 
 paragraphs are and browsers know how to display them. In HTML4, tags like <b> and <i> are not semantic, because they define 
 only how the text should look (bold or italic) and do not provide any additional meaning.
MyIdeas:
semantics elements are use for the developer and browser to understand the markup language. HTML5 introduces new semantics
 <article>   
  <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <header>
    <main>
    <mark>
    <nav>
    <section>
    <summary>
    <time>

2) why do we need to use sematic elements? advantages?

KEY BENEFITS OF SEMANTIC HTML

Let’s discuss some main advantages of using Semantically-Styled HTML markups :
1. User-friendliness : It is the biggest advantage of using semantically-correct HTML markups. Such codes are easy to use, clean and more readable. The semantic HTML codes can be easily edited in the future.
2. Better Accessibility : It is another important  area of a web page that can’t be ignored. The semantic codes play a great role in enhancing the overall accessibility of a website.It also helps in conveying the better meaning without compromising the accessibility od code structure. It is quite obvious when you properly code the elements of your web pages such as titles, headings, paragraphs, and lists with semantic codes, you’re actually making the site more compliant with the accessibility guidelines followed by the web browsers.
3. Lighter Code Structure : The light weighted Semantic HTML styled by CSS codes help in enhancing the downloading speed of the site and make web pages load faster. The fast loading website is the good practice that can make the web page more accessible amongst the users as well as serach engines.

Better search engine rankings
More maintainable code
Easier code to style with CSS
More accessible code for blind and partially sighted users
You are future proofing your code
You are using the right tools for the job

Semantic html is important because it’s:
 Clean — It’s easier to read and edit, which saves time and money during maintenance.

Imagine adding the non-semantic class=”red” to a span of text. Later you decide that text should be green. That’s going to be confusing to someone editing the html at a later date.

Better would be to use something like class=”price” (assuming the content is a price on an ecommerce site). You could then change the color from red to green to blue to orange without confusing what that content is.

 More accessible — It can be better understood by a greater variety of devices. Those devices can then add their own style and presentation based on what’s best for the device.

 A screen reader could raise and lower volume to communicate the hierarchy of your h1-h6 tags for example since you’ve clearly indicated a hierarchy.

 The more meaningful the structure of your content, the better different tools can make use of your content.
 Search engine friendly — This is still debatable as search engines rank content and not code, but search engines are making greater use of things like microformats to understand content.

    Many visually impaired people rely on speech browsers to read pages back to them. These programs cannot interpret pages very well unless they are clearly explained. In other words semantic code aids accessibility
    Search engines need to understand what your content is about in order to rank you properly on search engines. Semantic code tends to improve your placement on search engines, as it is easier for the "search engine spiders" to understand.

Searchability
Accessibility
Consistency

MyIdeas:
The advantages of semantics is helps for the clean code and reusability and search engine optimisation.
